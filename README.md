I would give 'The Office' a 9.9/10; It's one of my favorite shows, and you can watch it multple times without getting bored. I have a 9.8 becuase it was a little bit better when Steve Carrel was still on the show.
## Modern Family (2009)

Modern Family is another one of my favorites, and I would rate it 10/10. I really enjoyed Modern Family, and have also watched this show multiple times. It is good in all seasons.

## Schitt's Creek (2015)

Schitt's Creek is a really funny show, that I would rate a 9.7/10. I think this is more of a one-time watch, and it's a rich family who's money is taken by their financial advisor, and have to move from their mansion to a small rural town, known as Schitt's Creek.  
## The Crown (2016)

If you are looking for a more serious show, I definately reccomend "The Crown," and would rate it as 9.8/10. "The Crown" is a show about the British royal family since Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne. It has drama, and both fictional and nonfictional aspects to it. The actors fit the characters really well, and they change the actors as they age through the seasons, whcih keeps it kind of realistic.
