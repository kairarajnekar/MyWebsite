# TV Show Reccomendations
# Here are some TV shows I reccomend watching!
## The Office
I would give 'The Office' a 9.8/10; It's one of my favorite shows, and you can watch it multple times without getting bored. I have a 9.8 becuase it was a little bit better when Steve Carrel was still on the show.
