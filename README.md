I would give 'The Office' a 9.9/10; It's one of my favorite shows, and you can watch it multple times without getting bored. I have a 9.8 becuase it was a little bit better when Steve Carrel was still on the show.
## Modern Family (2009)

Modern Family is another one of my favorites, and I would rate it 10/10. I really enjoyed Modern Family, and have also watched this show multiple times. It is good in all seasons.
## Schitt's Creek (2015)

Schitt's Creek is a really funny show, that I would rate a 9.7/10. I think this is more of a one-time watch, and it's a rich family who's money is taken by their financial advisor, and have to move from their mansion to a small rural town, known as Schitt's Creek.
